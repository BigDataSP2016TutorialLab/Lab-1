##Question: 1
###Hadoop Map Reduce Algorithm

Implement MapReduce algorithm for finding Facebook common friends problem and run the Map Reduce job on Apache Hadoop. Write a report including your algorithm and result screenshots.

##Brief Description about your implementation : 

This algorithm should find the best path in finding the mutual friends between two friends. Here we input the text file with the friends list and their links to friends. Then the program will take that input and analyze the input and make the mappings and reduce them to the list where we can find the mutual friends among two friends.

##Question: 2
###Smart Watch Application

Smartphone/Watch Application Implement a smartwatch/smartphone application using existing speech services/image services (e.g., IBM Alchemy api, Face++) related to your project.

##Brief Description about your implementation : 

Here I have used Face plus plus API which I have used in my previous semester project. This API will take image as input and send it to the Face plus plus API server and get the coordinates of the number of faces identified. Then this program will calculate the max length and width from the facial focal point and then draw a box/lines around the facial focal point.

##API Used: Face Plus Plus

##Issues Faced while using API:
The Face plus plus generated secret keys and api keys are not working right away. We have to change the designation of the user on the applicaiton to developer and a mail to the development team of face plus plus, then the api keys are working.
